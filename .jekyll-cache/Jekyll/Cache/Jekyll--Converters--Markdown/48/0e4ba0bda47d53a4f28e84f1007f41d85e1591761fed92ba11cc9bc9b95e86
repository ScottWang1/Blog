<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.</p>

Container: A container is an application or a group of applications that runs independently and is an entity that mirrors the runtime.<br />
Repository: Repository is used to save images, which can be understood as a code warehouse in code control</p>
