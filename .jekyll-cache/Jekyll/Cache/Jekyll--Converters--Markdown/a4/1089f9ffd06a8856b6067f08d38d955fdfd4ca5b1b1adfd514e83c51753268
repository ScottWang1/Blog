<h2 id="mark-sweep">Mark-sweep</h2>
<p>The first algorithm that we look at is mark-sweep collection. It is a straightforward embodiment of the recursive definition of pointer reachability. Collection operates in two phases. First, the collector traverses the graph of objects, starting from the roots (registers, thread stacks, global variables) through which the program might immediately access objects and then following pointers and marking each object that it finds. Such a traversal is called tracing. In the second, sweeping phase, the collector examines every object in the heap: any unmarked object is deemed to be garbage and its space reclaimed.
Mark-sweep is an indirect collection algorithm. It does not detect garbage per se, but rather identifies all the live objects and then concludes that anything else must be garbage. Note that it needs to recalculate its estimate of the set of live objects at each invocation. Not all garbage collection algorithms behave like this.

<p>Termination of the marking phase is enforced by not adding already marked objects to the work list, so that eventually the list will become empty. At this point, every object reachable from the roots will have been visited and its mark-bit will have been set. Any unmarked object is therefore garbage.

The sweep phase returns unmarked nodes to the allocator (Algorithm 2.3). Typically,
the collector sweeps the heap linearly, starting from the bottom, freeing unmarked nodes
and resetting the mark-bits of marked nodes in preparation for the next collection cycle.</p>
<h5 id="bitmap-marking">Bitmap marking</h5>
<p>It can be improved by Bitmap marking. With a bitmap, marking will not modify any object, but will only read pointer fields of live objects. Other than loading the type descriptor field, no other part of pointer-free objects will be accessed. Sweeping will not read or write to any live object although it may overwrite fields of garbage objects as part of freeing them (for example to link them into a free-list). Thus bitmap marking is likely to modify fewer words, and to dirty fewer cache lines so less data needs to be written back to memory. Bitmap marking was also motivated by the concern to minimise the amount of paging caused by the collector</p>
<h5 id="lazy-sweeping">Lazy sweeping</h5>
<p>We observe two properties of objects and their mark-bits. First, once an object is garbage, it remains garbage: it can neither be seen nor be resurrected by a mutator. Second, mutators cannot access mark-bits. Thus, the sweeper can be executed in parallel with mutator threads, modifying mark-bits and even overwriting fields of garbage objects to link them into allocator structures. The sweeper (or sweepers) could be executed as separate threads, running concurrently with the mutator threads, but a simple solution is to use lazy sweeping. Lazy sweeping amortises the cost of sweeping by having the allocator perform the sweep. Rather than a separate sweep phase, the responsibility for finding free space is devolved to allocate. At its simplest, allocate advances the sweep pointer until it finds sufficient space in a sequence of unmarked objects. However, it is more practical to sweep a block of several objects at a time.</p>

<p>Lazy sweeping offers a number of benefits. It has good locality: object slots tend to be used soon after they are swept. It reduces the algorithmic complexity of mark-sweep to be proportional to the size of the live data in the heap, the same as semispace copying collection</p>
<h2 id="mark-compact-garbage-collection">Mark-compact garbage collection</h2>
<p>The strategy we consider is in-place compaction of objects into one end of the same region.</p>
<h5 id="two-finger-compaction">Two-finger compaction</h5>
<p>This Agorithm starts with two pointers or â€˜fingersâ€™, free which points to the start of the region and scan which starts at the end of the region. The first pass repeatedly advances the free pointer until it finds a gap (an unmarked object) in the heap, and retreats the scan pointer until it finds a live object. If the free and scan fingers pass each other, the phase is complete. Otherwise, the object at scan is moved into the gap at free, overwriting a field of the old copy (at scan) with a forwarding address, and the process continue.
<img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/3.1.png" alt="å›¾ç‰‡pic1" />
The benefits of this algorithm are that it is simple and fast, doing minimal work at each iteration, but the order of objects in the heap that results from this style of compaction is arbitrary, and this tends to harm the mutatorâ€™s locality.</p>
<h5 id="the-lisp-2-algorithm">The Lisp 2 algorithm</h5>
<p>The first pass over the heap (after marking) computes the location to which each live object will be moved, and stores this address in the objectâ€™s forwardingAddress field (Algorithm 3.2). The computeLocations routine takes three arguments: the addresses of the start and the end of the region of the heap to be compacted, and the start of the region into which the compacted objects are to be moved. Typically the destination region will be the same as the region being compacted, but parallel compactor threads may use their own distinct source and destination regions. The computeLocations procedure moves two â€˜fingersâ€™ through the heap: scan iterates through each object (live or dead) in the source region, and free points to the next free location in the destination region. If the object discovered by scan is live, it will (eventually) be moved to the location pointed to by free so free is written into its f orwardingAddress field, and is then incremented by the size of the object . If the object is dead, it is ignored.</p>

<p>The second pass updates the roots of mutator threads and references in marked objects so that they refer to the new locations of their targets, using the forwarding address stored in each about-to-be-relocated objectâ€™s header by the first pass. Finally, in the third pass, relocate moves each live (marked) object in a region to its new destination.
<img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/3.2.png" alt="å›¾ç‰‡pic1" />
It makes three passes over the heap, each iteration does little work.The chief drawback of the Lisp 2 algorithm is that it requires an additional full-slot field in every object header to store the address to which the object is to be moved.</p>
<h5 id="one-pass-algorithms">One-pass algorithms</h5>
<p>Marking sets the bits corresponding to the first and last granules of each live object. For example, bits 16 and 19 are set for the object marked old in Figure 3.3. By scrutinising the mark bitmap in the compaction phase, the collector can calculate the size of any live object.

<h5 id="summary">Summary</h5>
<p>Mark-sweep garbage collection uses less memory than other techniques such as copying collection (which we discuss in the next chapter). Furthermore, since it does not move objects, a mark-sweep collector need only identify (a superset of) the roots of the collection; it does not need to modify them. Both of these considerations may be important in environments where memory is tight or where the run-time system cannot provide type-accurate identification of references.</p>

<p>As a non-moving collector, mark-sweep is vulnerable to fragmentation. Using a parsimonious allocation strategy like sequential-fits reduces the likelihood of of fragmentation becoming a problem, provided that the application does not allocate very many large objects and that the ratio of object sizes does not change much. However, fragmentation is certainly likely to be a problem if a general-purpose, non-moving allocator is used to allocate a wide variety of objects in a long-running application. For this reason, most production Java virtual machines use moving collectors that can compact the heap.</p>
<h2 id="copying-garbage-collection">Copying garbage collection</h2>
<p>Copying compacts the heap, thus allowing fast allocation, yet requires only a single pass over the live objects in the heap. Its chief disadvantage is that it reduces the size of the available heap by half.
<img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/copy.png" alt="å›¾ç‰‡pic1" />
The main purpose of Copying garbage collection is to solve the debris generated by the mark-and-sweep algorithm.</p>
<h5 id="summary-1">Summary</h5>
<p>Compare mark-sweep and copying collection. Mark-sweep collectors have twice as much usable heap space available as do copying collectors, and hence will perform half as many collections, all other things being equal. Consequently, we might expect that mark-sweep collection offer better overall performance. Blackburn et al [2004a] found that this was indeed the case for collection in tight heaps, where he used a segregated-fits allocator for the non-moving collector. Conversely, in large heaps the locality benefits to the mutator of sequential allocation outweighed the space efficiency of mark-sweep collection, leading to better miss rates at all levels of the cache hierarchy. This was particularly true for newly allocated objects which tend to experience higher mutation rates than older objects.</p>

<p>Copying collection offers two immediately attractive advantages over non-moving
collectors like mark-sweep: fast allocation and the elimination of fragmentation (other than to
satisfy alignment requirements). Simple copying collectors are also easier to implement
than mark-sweep or mark-compact collectors. The trade-off is that copying collection uses
twice as much virtual memory as other collectors in order to match their frequency of collections.</p>

<p>The immediate disadvantage of semispace copying is the need to maintain a second semi- space. For a given memory budget and ignoring the data structures needed by the collector itself, semispace copying provides only half the heap space of that offered by other whole heap collectors. The consequence is that copying collectors will perform more garbage collection cycles than other collectors. Whether or not this translates into better or worse performance depends on trade-offs between the mutator and the collector, the characteristics of the application program and the volume of heap space available.</p>
